## Command Line Options

- `--entity-id`: Specify one or more companies to analyze (default: 1 for MicroStrategy). Can specify multiple IDs separated by spaces.
- `--start-date`: Start date for analysis in YYYY-MM-DD format (default: 2024-01-01)

- `--csv`: Export data to CSV files with timestamps. Creates individual files for each company and a combined file when multiple entities are specified.

## Key Metrics Explained

### BTC per Share
- **Definition**: The amount of bitcoin owned per share of MicroStrategy stock
- **Formula**: BTC per Share = Total BTC Holdings / Shares Outstanding
- **Example**: 0.00213833 BTC/share means each share represents ownership of approximately 0.00214 bitcoin
- **Importance**: Core metric for tracking MicroStrategy's bitcoin accumulation strategy

### mNAV (Market-to-Net Asset Value)
- **Definition**: The ratio of MicroStrategy's market capitalization to its Net Asset Value (NAV)
- **Formula**: mNAV = Market Cap / NAV
- **Interpretation**:
  - mNAV > 1: Stock trades at a premium to bitcoin holdings
  - mNAV = 1: Stock trades at par with bitcoin holdings
  - mNAV < 1: Stock trades at a discount to bitcoin holdings
- **Example**: mNAV of 1.656 = 65.6% premium to NAV

### Bitcoin Yield
- **Definition**: The percentage increase in BTC per share over a specific time period
- **Formula**: Bitcoin Yield = (BTC per share end - BTC per share start) / BTC per share start Ã— 100%
- **Purpose**: Measures effectiveness of capital raising and bitcoin accumulation strategy
- **Example**: If BTC/share increases from 0.00200 to 0.00214, that's a 7% Bitcoin Yield

### BYD (Bitcoin Yield Days)
- **Definition**: The number of days required to achieve a certain Bitcoin Yield at the current accumulation rate
- **Purpose**: Normalizes Bitcoin Yield to a daily rate for easier comparison
- **Calculation**: Uses annualized Bitcoin Yield divided by 365 to determine daily yield rate

### P/BYD Ratio (Premium to Bitcoin Yield Days)
- **Definition**: Valuation metric relating MicroStrategy's stock premium to its Bitcoin Yield generation capability
- **Formula**: P/BYD = (mNAV - 1) / (Bitcoin Yield Rate)
- **Interpretation**: Indicates how many days/years of Bitcoin Yield the current premium represents
- **Use Case**: Helps investors assess whether the stock premium is justified by the company's BTC accumulation rate

## API Data Structure

The Bitcoin Treasuries API provides the following key data fields:
- `btcBalances`: Historical bitcoin holdings
- `btcPerShare`: Historical BTC per share values
- `navMultipliers`: Historical mNAV values
- `stockPrices`: Historical stock prices
- `btcPrices`: Historical bitcoin prices

## Example Output

```
Fetching MicroStrategy data...

Result:
BTC per Share on June 30, 2025: 0.00213833
Total BTC Holdings: 597,325
Implied Shares Outstanding: 279,341,823

## Investment Considerations

These metrics are essential for understanding MicroStrategy as a "Bitcoin Development Company" that aims to:
1. Continuously increase BTC per share through strategic capital raises
2. Leverage various financial instruments (convertible bonds, ATM equity offerings)
3. Create value for shareholders beyond simply holding bitcoin
